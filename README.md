This homework assignment was assigned to us, requesting that we use HTML scemantic elements that we previously learned within the class to replace the undescriptive indicators that were present in the code. 
A list of the HTML scemantic elements that were used to replace the undiscriptive div's are as follows
- article
- aside
- figure
- footer
- header
- main
- nav
- section

Each element listed above is descriptive in it's functionality and purpose within HTML this eliminating confusion that may occur when a colleague or another individual looks at the code. Incomparison to the document before and editations, one may become confused due to the lack of descriptive semantic elements as divs are not descriptive in their function.
