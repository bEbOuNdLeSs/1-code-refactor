This homework assignment was assigned to us, requesting that we use HTML scemantic elements that we previously learned within the class to replace the undescriptive indicators that were present in the code. 
A list of the HTML scemantic elements that were used to replace the undiscriptive div's are as follows
## article
# aside
# figure
# footer
# header
# main
# nav
# section
